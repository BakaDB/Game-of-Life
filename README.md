# Game of Life
[Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) is a 2D cellular automaton in which cells may take 2 states (dead or alive). Also these cells must follow this 4 rules:
* Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies, as if by underpopulation.
* Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.
* Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by overpopulation.
* Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.

## Gameplay
This is a 0 players game. Configure the initial board by right clicking the different squares and see how it evolves.
A start/stop button was added to be able to tweak the configuration mid-game.

There are many grid configurations to try out, but I recommend checking out these few [examples](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life#Examples_of_patterns) to start with.

## Instructions
Execute the Game.java class.
